(qqq) "Veteran Free Agent" means a Veteran who completed his Player Contract (other than a 10-Day
Contract) by rendering the playing services called for thereunder.
      (rrr) "Years of Service" means the number of years of NBA service credited to a player in accordance with
the following: a player will be credited with one year of NBA service for each year that he is signed to a Uniform
Player Contract to play for an NBA Team, whether or not his services are retained by that NBA Team for the
start, or for any portion, of the year for which he is signed; provided, however, that if a player signs a Player
Contract with a stated term of more than one year: (i) he will receive credit for the first year of such Contract;
and (ii) with respect to each subsequent year of the Contract, he will receive credit for such year only if the
Contract has not been terminated prior to the first day of the Season in such subsequent year. Notwithstanding the
above, a player will not receive credit for a Year of Service for any year in which he: (x) withholds playing
services called for by a Player Contract for more than thirty (30) days after the Season begins, (y) is signed only
to one or more 10-Day Contracts, or (z) is a Restricted Free Agent, has been tendered a Qualifying Offer by his
Prior Team that has been expressly left open by that Team until at least March 1, and has not signed a Player
Contract with any Team by March 1. In addition, notwithstanding the above, a player will not receive credit for a
Year of Service for a Player Contract that is voided due to the player's failure to pass a physical examination or
that is disapproved by the Commissioner. In no event can a player be credited with more than one (1) Year of
Service with respect to any one NBA Season. A Year of Service will be credited to a player on the June 30
following the Season with respect to which it is being credited. Under no circumstances shall the definition of
Years of Service herein be used for purposes of determining a player's years of Credited Service under the NBA
Players Pension Plan.

                                      UNIFORM PLAYER CONTRACT
Section 1.       Required Form.
      The Player Contract to be entered into by each player and the Team by which he is employed shall be a
Uniform Player Contract in the form annexed hereto as Exhibit A.
Section 2.       Limitation on Amendments.
      (a) Except as provided in Sections 3, 6, 7(d), 8, 9, 10 and 11 of this Article, and in Article VII, Section 7
(Extensions, Renegotiations and Other Amendments) or Article XII (Option Clauses), no amendments to the
form of Uniform Player Contract provided for by Section 1 of this Article shall be permitted.
      (b) If a Team and a player enter into (i) a Uniform Player Contract containing an amendment not specifically
permitted by this Agreement or (ii) a subsequent amendment to an existing Player Contract where such
amendment is not specifically permitted by this Agreement, then such Contract or subsequent amendment, as the
case may be, shall be disapproved by the Commissioner and, consequently, rendered null and void.
Section 3.       Allowable Amendments.
      In their individual contract negotiations, a player and a Team may amend the provisions of a Uniform Player
Contract, but only in the following respects:
      (a) By agreeing upon provisions (to be set forth in Exhibit 1 to a Uniform Player Contract) setting forth the
Cash Compensation to be paid or amounts to be loaned to the player for each Season of the Contract for
rendering the services described in such Contract.
      (b) By agreeing upon provisions (to be set forth in Exhibit 1 to a Uniform Player Contract) setting forth the
Non-Cash Compensation to be paid or provided to the player for rendering the services described in such
Contract.(c) By agreeing upon provisions (to be set forth in Exhibit 1 to a Uniform Player Contract) setting forth
lump                                                     sum                                                 bonuses,
and        the      payment       schedule       therefore,     to      be      paid     as      a      result     of:
(i) the player's execution of a Uniform Player Contract or Extension (a "signing bonus"), (ii) the exercise or non-
exercise of an option pursuant to Articles VII and XII, (iii) the player's achievement of agreed-upon benchmarks
relating to his performance as a player or the Team's performance during a particular NBA Season, subject to the
limitations imposed by paragraph 3(c) of the Uniform Player Contract, or (iv) the player's achievement of agreed-
upon benchmarks relating to his physical condition or academic achievement, including the player's attendance at
and participation in an off-season summer league and/or an off-season skill and conditioning program designated
by the Team (subject to the limitations imposed by Section 11(h) below). Any amendment agreed upon pursuant
to subsections (iii) or (iv) of this subsection (c) must be structured so as to provide an incentive for positive
achievement by the player and/or the Team; and any amendment agreed upon pursuant to subsection (iii) must be
based upon specific numerical benchmarks or generally recognized league honors. By way of example and not
limitation,
an amendment agreed upon pursuant to subsection (iii) may provide for the player to receive a bonus if his free-
throw percentage exceeds 80\%, but may not provide for the player to receive a bonus if his free-throw percentage
improves over his previous season's percentage.
      (d) By agreeing upon provisions (to be set forth in Exhibit 1 to a Uniform Player Contract) with respect to
extra promotional appearances to be performed by the player (in addition to those required by paragraph 13 of
such Contract) and the Compensation therefor.
      (e) By agreeing upon a Compensation payment schedule (to be set forth in Exhibit 1 to a Uniform Player
Contract) different from that provided for by paragraph 3(a) of the Uniform Player Contract; provided, however,
such amendment shall comply with the provisions of Section 11(f) below and that no such amendment shall be
permitted with respect to any Season in which the player's Compensation is not greater than the Minimum Player
Salary called for with respect to that Season pursuant to Section 6 below.
      (f) By agreeing upon provisions (to be set forth in Exhibit 2 to a Uniform Player Contract) stating that the
Cash Compensation provided for by a Uniform Player Contract (as described in Exhibit 1 to such Contract) shall
be, in whole or in part, and subject to any conditions or limitations, protected or insured (as provided for by, and
in accordance with the definitions set forth in, Section 4 below) in the event that such Contract is terminated by
the Team by reason of the player's:
            (i)   lack of skill;
            (ii)  death not covered by an insurance policy procured by a Team for the player's benefit ("non-
                  insured death");

                  death");
            (iv) disability or unfitness to play skilled basketball resulting from a basketball-related injury not
                  covered by an insurance policy procured by a Team for the player's benefit ("non-insured

            (v)   disability or unfitness to play skilled basketball resulting from any injury or illness not covered
                  by an insurance policy procured by a Team for the player's benefit ("non-insured injury or
                  illness");
            (vi) disability or unfitness to play skilled basketball resulting from an injury or illness covered by an
                  insurance policy procured by a Team for the player's benefit ("insured injury or illness");
            (vii) mental disability not covered by an insurance policy procured by a Team for the player's benefit
                  ("non-insured mental disability"); and/or(viii) mental disability covered by an insurance policy procured by a Team for the player's benefit
                   ("insured mental disability").
      (g) By agreeing upon provisions (to be set forth in Exhibit 3 to a Uniform Player Contract) limiting or
eliminating the player's right to receive his Cash Compensation (in accordance with paragraphs 7(c), 16(a)(iii),
and 16(b) of the Uniform Player Contract) when the player's disability or unfitness to play skilled basketball is
caused by the re-injury of an injury sustained prior to, or by the aggravation of a condition that existed prior to,
the execution of the Uniform Player Contract providing for such Cash Compensation.
      (h) By agreeing upon provisions (to be set forth in Exhibit 4 to a Uniform Player Contract) (i) entitling a

either case (i) or (ii) to the provisions of Article XXIV.
      (i) By agreeing upon provisions (to be set forth in Exhibit 5 to a Uniform Player Contract) permitting the
player to participate or engage in some or all of the activities otherwise prohibited by paragraph 12 of the

date                                     and                                   time                                  of
a physical examination of the player to be performed by a physician designated by the Team within seventy-two
(72) hours of the execution of the Contract, the passage of such examination by the player (in the sole discretion
of the Team) to be a condition precedent to the validity of the player's Uniform Player Contract.
      (k) By agreeing to delete clauses (b)(ii) and/or (b)(iii) of paragraph 5 of the Uniform Player Contract in their
entirety.
      (l) By agreeing to delete paragraph 7(b) of the Uniform Player Contract in its entirety and substituting
therefor the provision set forth in Exhibit 7 to a Uniform Player Contract.

Contract.

      (o) By agreeing upon provisions (to be set forth in Exhibit 8 to a Uniform Player Contract) stating that the
Contract will be assigned to another team within forty-eight (48) hours of its execution, such assignment and the
consummation of such assignment to be conditions precedent to the validity of the Contract; provided, however,
that any such sign-and-trade transaction must comply with Article VII, Section 8(e).
Section 4.       Cash Compensation Protection or Insurance.(a) Lack of Skill. When a Team agrees to protect, in whole or in part, the Cash Compensation provided for
by a Uniform Player Contract in the event such Contract is terminated by the Team, pursuant to paragraph
16(a)(iii) thereof, by reason of the player's lack of skill, such agreement shall mean that, subject to any

conditions and limitations set forth in this Section 4(b)), notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 16(a),
16(b), 16(c), 16(d), 16(e), and 16(g) of such Contract, the termination of such Contract by the Team on account
of the player's failure to render his services thereunder, if such failure has been caused by the player's death,
shall in no way affect the player's (or his estate's or duly appointed beneficiary's) right to receive, in whole or in
part, the Cash Compensation payable pursuant to Exhibit 1 to such Contract in the amounts and at the times
called for by such Exhibit; provided, however, that (i) such death does not result from the player's participation

not result from an attempted suicide or the use of any controlled substance; (ii) at the time of the player's

this Agreement that do not otherwise so provide, shall be deemed amended in such manner to require the parties
to comply with all terms of this Agreement, including the terms of the Uniform Player Contract annexed hereto
as Exhibit A. All Player Contracts shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement, which shall supersede the
terms of any Player Contract inconsistent herewith. No Player Contract shall provide for the waiver by a player or

the allocation of signing bonuses and deemed signing bonuses (but no other bonuses) shall be considered as part
of the Salary provided for by a Player Contract, provided that such Player Contract makes clear that the Salary
for each Season (including the allocation of such bonuses) equals or exceeds the Minimum Player Salary for such
Season.
     (d) On July 1 of each Salary Cap Year, any Player Contract (whether entered into before or after the date of
this                                                Agreement)                                                 that
provides for a Salary for the upcoming Season that is less than the applicable Minimum Player Salary shall be
deemed amended to provide for the applicable Minimum Player Salary.
     (e) Nothing in this Section 6 shall alter the respective rights and liabilities of a player and a Team, as
provided for in the Uniform Player Contract or in this Agreement, with respect to the termination of a Player
Contract.

intended to provide for a Salary for the         Season(s) equal to the Minimum Player Salary for such Season(s)
(with no Unlikely Bonuses) and shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to so provide."

           (i)  For any player who has completed fewer than seven (7) Years of Service, the greater of (x) 25\%
                of the Salary Cap in effect at the time the Contract is executed, (y) 105\% of the Salary for the

     (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no Renegotiation entered into after the date of
this Agreement may provide for a Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses in the Renegotiation Season (as defined in
Article VII, Section 7(c)) that exceeds the following amounts:
          (i)   For any player who has completed fewer than seven (7) Years of Service, the greater of (x) 25\%
                of the Salary Cap in effect at the time the Renegotiation is executed, (y) 105\% of the Salary for
                the Season prior to the Renegotiation Season, or (z) \$9 million.
          (ii) For any player who has completed at least seven (7) but fewer than ten (10) Years of Service, the
                greater of (x) 30\% of the Salary Cap in effect at the time the Renegotiation is executed, (y) 105\%
                of the Salary for the Season prior to the Renegotiation Season, or (z) \$11 million.
          (iii) For any player who has completed ten (10) or more Years of Service, the greater of (x) 35\% of the
                Salary Cap in effect at the time the Renegotiation is executed, (y) 105\% of the Salary for the
                Season prior to the Renegotiation Season, or (z) \$14 million.
     (c) The parties recognize that it may not be possible to ascertain at the time an Extension is executed
whether the Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses called for in the first Season of the extended term will exceed the
Maximum Annual Salary set forth in this Section 7. Accordingly, and notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, the following rule shall apply to an Extension entered into in accordance with Article VII, Section
7(a) or a Rookie Scale Extension entered into in accordance with Article VII, Section 7(b) after the date of this
Agreement: if, on the August 1 of the Salary Cap Year encompassing the first Season of the extended term of
such Extension, the Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses provided for in such Season exceeds the following amounts:
          (i)   For any player who has completed fewer than seven (7) Years of Service, the greater of (x) 25\%
                of the Salary Cap in effect on such August 1, (y) 105\% of the Salary provided for in the final
                Season of the original term of the Contract, or (z) \$9 million;
          (ii) For any player who has completed at least seven (7) but fewer than ten (10) Years of Service, the
                greater of (x) 30\% of the Salary Cap in effect on such August 1, (y) 105\% of the Salary provided
                for in the final Season of the original term of the Contract, or (z) \$11 million; or
          (iii) For any player who has completed ten (10) or more Years of Service, the greater of (x) 35\% of the
                Salary Cap in effect on such August 1, (y) 105\% of the Salary provided for in the final Season of
                the original term of the Contract, or (z) \$14 million;
then such Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses shall immediately be deemed amended to provide for the maximum
amount allowed by the applicable subsection (c)(i), (c)(ii), or (c)(iii) set forth above. In such circumstance,
Salaries plus Unlikely Bonuses in subsequent Seasons of the extended term shall also immediately be deemed
amended to provide for increases or decreases over the amended Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses in the first Season
of the extended term in accordance with Article VII, Section 5(c).(d) A        player       and        a       Team       may        provide         in      a      Rookie         Scale
Extension         that      the        player's      Salary       (in       the        first      Season        of        the
extended          term)        will         equal      "the        Maximum             Annual         Salary         applic-
able to such player in the first Season of the extended term," and that the Salaries in any subsequent Seasons of
the extended term will be increased or decreased based on percentages specified by the parties that comply with
Article VII, Section 5(c). Any such Rookie Scale Extension shall be deemed amended on August 1 of the Salary
Cap Year covering the first Season of the extended term to provide for specific Salaries for each Season of the
extended term, based on the Maximum Annual Salary applicable to such player on such August 1. A Rookie
Scale Extension entered into pursuant to this subsection may not include any Incentive Compensation.
     (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no assignment of a Uniform Player Contract
entered into after the date of this Agreement may, by reason of an assignment bonus contained in such Contract,
cause the player's Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses for the Salary Cap Year in which such assignment occurs to
exceed the following amounts:
           (i)   For any player who has completed fewer than seven (7) Years of Service, the greater of (x) 25\%
                 of the Salary Cap in effect at the time the assignment bonus is earned, (y) 105\% of the player's
                 Salary for the Season prior to the Season in which the assignment bonus is earned, or (z) \$9
                 million.
           (ii) For any player who has at least seven (7) but fewer than ten (10) Years of Service, the greater of
                 (x) 30\% of the Salary Cap in effect at the time the assignment bonus is earned, (y) 105\% of the
                 player's Salary for the Season prior to the Season in which the assignment bonus is earned, or (z)
                 \$11 million.
           (iii) For any player who has completed ten (10) or more Years of Service, the greater of (x) 35\% of the
                 Salary Cap in effect at the time the assignment bonus is earned, (y) 105\% of the player's Salary
                 for the Season prior to the Season in which the assignment bonus is earned, or (z) \$14 million.
     (f) For purposes of calculating the Maximum Annual Salary for the 2000-01 Salary Cap Year pursuant to
Sections 7(a)(i)(x), 7(a)(ii)(x), 7(a)(iii)(x), 7(b)(i)(x), 7(b)(ii)(x), 7(b)(iii)(x), 7(c)(i)(x), 7(c)(ii)(x), 7(c)(iii)(x),
7(e)(i)(x), 7(e)(ii)(x), and 7(e)(iii)(x), the Salary Cap shall be the Salary Cap without any adjustment pursuant to
Article VII, Section 2(d)(1).
Section 8.       Promotional Activities.
     (a) A player's obligation (pursuant to paragraph 13(d) of a Uniform Player Contract) to participate, upon
request, in all other reasonable promotional activities of the Team and the NBA shall be deemed satisfied if,
during each year of the period covered by such Contract, the Player makes five individual personal appearances
and five group appearances for or on behalf of or at the request of the Team (or Team Affiliate) by which he is
employed and/or the NBA. Up to two of these ten appearances may be assigned by the Team and/or the NBA in
any year to NBA Properties. The Player shall be reimbursed for the actual expenses incurred in connection with
any such appearance, provided that such expenses result directly from the appearance and are ordinary and
reasonable. The Player shall also receive compensation from the Team by which he is employed of at least
\$1,000, in accordance with paragraph 13(d) of the Uniform Player Contract, for each promotional appearance he
makes for a commercial sponsor of such Team. Any personal or group appearance required under this subsection
(a) must:
           (i)   take place during (A) the period from the first day of a Season through the day of the NBA Draft
                 following such Season, or (B) the off-season, provided that no player may be required to make
                 more than one off-season appearance in any year covered by his Contract and no player may be
                 required to make such an off-season appearance unless he resides in or is otherwise located in the
                 area where the appearance is to take place;(ii) occur in the home city (or geographic vicinity thereof) of the player's Team (subject to subsection
                    (a)(i)(B) above) or in a city (or geographic vicinity thereof) to which the player has traveled to
                    play in a scheduled NBA game;
             (iii) not occur at a time that would interfere with a player's reasonable preparation to play on the day
                    of a Team game;
             (iv) not occur at a time that would interfere with a player's ability to attend and participate fully in any
                    practice session conducted by the Team, taking into account the commuting time from the practice
                    to the appearance;
             (v)    be scheduled with the player at least fourteen (14) days in advance (by providing written notice to
                    the player of the time, nature, location, and expected duration of the appearance) and called to his
                    attention again seven (7) days prior to the appearance;
             (vi) not exceed a reasonable period of time; and
             (vii) not require the player to sign autographs as the pri-mary purpose of the appearance.
Section 9.          10-Day Contracts.
      (a) Beginning on January 5 (if a business day) or the first business day following January 5 of any NBA
Season, and solely for the purpose of replacing an injured player, a Team may enter into a Player Contract with a
player for the longer of (i) ten (10) days, or (ii) a period encompassing three (3) games played by such Team (a
"10-Day Contract"). No Team may enter into a 10-Day Contract with the same player more than twice during the
course of any one Season.
      (b) The Salary provided for by a 10-Day Contract shall not be less than the Minimum Player Salary.
      (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in a Uniform Player Contract, a 10-Day Contract
shall be terminated simply by providing written notice to the player (and not by following the waiver procedure
set forth in paragraph 16 of the Uniform Player Contract) and paying only such sums as are set forth in Exhibit 1
of such Contract.
Section 10. Rest-of-Season Contracts.
      (a) At any time after the first day of an NBA Regular Season, a Team may enter into a Player Contract that
may provide Compensation to a player only for the remainder of that Season (a "Rest-of-Season Contract").
      (b) The Salary provided for in a Rest-of-Season Contract shall not be less than the Minimum Player Salary.
Section 11. General.
       (a) (i) Subject to Section 12 below, any oral or written agreement between a player and a Team
                  concerning terms and conditions of employment shall be reduced to writing in the form of a
                  Uniform Player Contract or an amendment thereto as soon as practicable. Immediately upon the
                  consummation of any such agreement, the Team shall notify the NBA by facsimile or e-mail and
                  provide the NBA with all economic terms of such agreement. Upon its receipt of such notice, the
                  NBA shall promptly provide the same notice to the Players Association.
        (ii)      Notwithstanding subsection (a)(i) above, neither the NBA nor the Players Association shall contend
                  that any agreement concerning terms and conditions of employment is binding upon the player or
                  the Team until a Player Contract embodying such terms and conditions has been duly executed by
                  the parties. Nothing herein is intended to affect (A) any authority of the Commissioner to approve
                  or disapprove Player Contracts, or (B) the effect of the Commissioner's approval or disapproval on
                  the validity of such Player Contracts.(iii)  A violation of the first sentence of subsection (a)(i) above may be considered evidence of a
               violation of Article XIII.
      (b) No player shall attend the regular training camp of any Team, or participate in organized practices with
the Team at any time, unless he is a party to a Player Contract then in effect. For purposes of this Section 11(b), a
player shall be considered to be a party to a Player Contract then in effect if such Contract has been extended in
accordance with an Option permitted by this Agreement.
      (c) No Team shall make any direct or indirect payment of any money, property, investments, loans, or
anything else of value for fees or otherwise to an agent, attorney, or representative of a player (for or in
connection with such person's representation of such player); nor shall any Player Contract provide for such
payment. The foregoing shall not, however, prevent a Team from sending a player's regular paycheck to a
player's agent, attorney, or representative if so instructed in writing by the player.
      (d) Notwithstanding            any           other         provision         of         this        Agreement,
(i) no Uniform Player Contract entered into after the date of this Agreement may provide for a signing bonus that
exceeds twenty-five (25) percent of the Compensation (excluding Incentive Compensation) called for by the
Contract (or, in the case of an Extension, by the extended term of the Extension), and (ii) no Offer Sheet may
provide for a signing bonus that exceeds twenty-five (25) percent of the Compensation (excluding Incentive
Compensation) called for by the Offer Sheet.
      (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement, no Uniform Player Contract entered into after the
date of this Agreement may provide for Non-Cash Compensation in any Season that exceeds twenty-five (25)
percent of the Compensation (excluding Incentive Compensation) called for with respect to such Season.
      (f) Commencing with the 2001-02 Salary Cap Year, and notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, every Uniform Player Contract entered into after the date of this Agreement must provide (and every
Uniform Player Contract entered into before the date of this Agreement shall be deemed to provide) that for each
Season of such Contract, the player will be paid at least thirty (30) percent of his Salary for such Season in
Current Cash Compensation and that such portion of Current Cash Compensation will be paid in accordance with
the payment schedule provided in paragraph 3 of the Contract.
      (g) No Uniform Player Contract may provide for the payment of any Compensation earned for a Season
prior to the July 1 immediately preceding such Season.
       (h) (i) No Uniform Player Contract may provide for the player's attendance at and participation in an off-
               season skill and conditioning program that exceeds two weeks in length.
         (ii)  A Uniform Player Contract that contains a bonus to be paid as a result of the player's attendance at
               and participation in an off-season summer league and/or an off-season skill and conditioning
               program designated by the Team may also contain a provision providing that such bonus will be
               paid if the player, in the sole discretion of a physician designated by the Team, has an injury, illness
               or other medical condition that renders the player unable to participate in such summer league
               and/or skill and conditioning program.
Section 12.     July Moratorium.
      Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no player and Team may enter into any oral or
written agreement concerning terms and conditions of the player's employment, or reduce any such agreement to
writing in the form of a Uniform Player Contract or amendment, during the month of July. The foregoing
sentence shall not preclude (i) a player from accepting any Required Tender or Qualifying Offer that is
outstanding during the month of July, or (ii) a player and a Team from negotiating, during the month of July, over
the terms and conditions of a Player Contract or Offer Sheet that may be entered into on or after August 1.
