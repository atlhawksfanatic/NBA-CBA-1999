                                        COLLECTION PROCEDURES
      When the player arrives at the collection site, the collector will ensure that the player is positively identified
through presentation of photo ID or identification by a team representative. If the player's identity cannot be
established, the collectors shall not proceed with the collection.
      The player will be asked to select a sealed urine specimen cup. The player will then provide his urine
specimen under the direct observation of the collector.
      The collector shall ensure that the player has provided a urine specimen of sufficient volume for accurate
testing. If such a sample cannot immediately be provided by the player, he shall be instructed to remain at the
testing site for a reasonable period of time until he can provide such a specimen. Once the specimen has been
obtained, the player will select a sealed specimen kit, which contains two bottles. The collector, in the presence
of the player, will pour the specimen into two bottles. One bottle will be used as the primary or "A" specimen and
the other will be used as the split or "B" specimen. The specimen bottles will be sealed with tamper-proof seals
in the presence of the player. The seals will contain a unique identification number that corresponds to the
number on the chain of custody form.
      The player and collector will complete the chain of custody form that documents the handling of the
specimen. The collector will note any irregularities concerning the specimen on the chain of custody form. Both
the player and collector will sign the chain of custody form. The chain of custody form along with the two
specimen bottles will be placed back into the kit. The kit will be sealed and sent via overnight courier to the
laboratory for testing.
      Once the specimen arrives at the laboratory, the primary specimen will be analyzed. If the primary specimen
tests positive, the split sample will be placed in frozen storage and will be available for testing by a different
laboratory, if requested by the player.

Dear Billy:
      This will confirm our agreement that a team's termination of a Uniform Player Contract by reason of the
player's "lack of skill" (under paragraph 16(a)(iii) thereof) shall be interpreted to include a termination based on
the team's determination that, in view of the player's level of skill (in the sole opinion of the Team), the
Compensation paid (or to be paid) to the player is no longer commensurate with the team's financial plans or
needs. This agreement shall not affect any post-termination obligation to pay Compensation that may result from
Compensation protection provisions included in a Uniform Player Contract.
      If the foregoing coincides with your understanding of our agreement, please sign this letter in the space
provided below.
                                           Sincerely,
