Section 1.        Exhibition Games.
      Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2 of the Uniform Player Contract, players shall be required to
participate in Exhibition games between an NBA Team and a non-member of the NBA at any location, within or
outside the United States, subject to the following conditions:
      (a) The NBA shall supervise the arrangements made with respect to tournaments or series conducted outside
the United States and the accommodations provided to NBA players participating in such foreign tournaments or
series.
      (b) The NBA shall use its best efforts to establish an Exhibition game schedule pursuant to which excessive
travel will be avoided and reasonable periods of time between games will be allotted.
      (c) In any year in which it is played, the annual Basketball Hall of Fame Exhibition game shall be
considered as one of the eight exhibition games prior to the Regular Season referred to in paragraph 2 of the
Uniform Player Contract.
Section 2.        Inter-squad Scrimmage.
      In addition to the Exhibition games provided for by paragraph 2 of the Uniform Player Contract, and during
each of the playoff series conducted during the term of this Agreement, any Team that qualifies for the playoffs
but is not required to participate in the first round thereof, may arrange and require its players to participate in
one inter-squad game or scrimmage with another similarly situated Team, provided that such game or scrimmage
is not open to members of the general public.
Section 3.        Off-Season Basketball Events.
      No player may play in any public off-season basketball game, summer league (e.g., Southern California Pro
League or the Rocky Mountain Revue Summer League), or public exhibition or competition of basketball skills
(e.g., a slam dunk contest or a "tour" organized by an NBA business partner) (each a "Basketball Event") unless
such Basketball Event is approved in writing by the NBA and complies with the terms and conditions of this
Section 3, or is conducted by, or with the written authorization of, NBA Properties
pursuant to the rights granted to NBA Properties in the Events Agreement. The NBA will consider an off-season
Basketball Event for approval only if a request for such approval is submitted in writing to the NBA prior to the
April 1 immediately preceding the off-season in which such Basketball Event is to be conducted, and only if the
arrangements made with respect to any such off-season Basketball Event are confirmed in writing by the NBA
and satisfy the following requirements, in addition to such other reasonable requirements as the NBA may
impose:
      (a) General Requirements.
            (i)    The Basketball Event takes place on or after July 1, but in no event later than September 15 (or, in

                 the NBA and the Players Association;
