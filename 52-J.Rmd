Dear Billy:

This will confirm our agreement that a team's termination of a Uniform Player Contract by reason of the player's "lack of skill" (under paragraph 16(a)(iii) thereof) shall be interpreted to include a termination based on the team's determination that, in view of the player's level of skill (in the sole opinion of the Team), the Compensation paid (or to be paid) to the player is no longer commensurate with the team's financial plans or needs. This agreement shall not affect any post-termination obligation to pay Compensation that may result from Compensation protection provisions included in a Uniform Player Contract.

If the foregoing coincides with your understanding of our agreement, please sign this letter in the space provided below.

Sincerely,  
/s/ <u>/s/  JEFFREY A. MISHKIN</u>
