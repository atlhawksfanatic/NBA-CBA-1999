<p>In their individual contract negotiations, a player and a Team may amend the provisions of a Uniform Player Contract, but only in the following respects:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>By agreeing upon provisions (to be set forth in Exhibit 1 to a Uniform Player Contract) setting forth the Cash Compensation to be paid or amounts to be loaned to the player for each Season of the Contract forrendering the services described in such Contract.</li>
<li>By agreeing upon provisions (to be set forth in Exhibit 1 to a Uniform Player Contract) setting forth the Non-Cash Compensation to be paid or provided to the player for rendering the services described in such Contract.</li>
<li>By agreeing upon provisions (to be set forth in Exhibit 1 to a Uniform Player Contract) setting forth lump sum bonuses, and the payment schedule therefore, to be paid as a result of: (i) the player’s execution of a Uniform Player Contract or Extension (a “signing bonus”), (ii) the exercise or non-exercise of an option pursuant to Articles VII and XII, (iii) the player’s achievement of agreed-upon benchmarks relating to his performance as a player or the Team’s performance during a particular NBA Season, subject to the limitations imposed by paragraph 3(c) of the Uniform Player Contract, or (iv) the player’s achievement of agreed-upon benchmarks relating to his physical condition or academic achievement, including the player’s attendance at and participation in an off-season summer league and/or an off-season skill and conditioning program designated by the Team (subject to the limitations imposed by Section 11(h) below). Any amendment agreed upon pursuant to subsections (iii) or (iv) of this subsection (c) must be structured so as to provide an incentive for positive achievement by the player and/or the Team; and any amendment agreed upon pursuant to subsection (iii) must be based upon specific numerical benchmarks or generally recognized league honors. By way of example and not limitation, an amendment agreed upon pursuant to subsection (iii) may provide for the player to receive a bonus if his free-throw percentage exceeds 80%, but may not provide for the player to receive a bonus if his free-throw percentage improves over his previous season’s percentage.</li>

<li>By agreeing upon provisions (to be set forth in Exhibit 8 to a Uniform Player Contract) stating that the Contract will be assigned to another team within forty-eight (48) hours of its execution, such assignment and the consummation of such assignment to be conditions precedent to the validity of the Contract; provided, however, that any such sign-and-trade transaction must comply with Article VII, Section 8(e).</li>
